## Commands

Use `cc!help` for a complete list of commands. There are so many that I lost track.

## How to install

Clone the repo, run `npm install`, set a `.env` file for the following variables: `BOT_TOKEN, COMMUNITY, DATABASE_URL`, make sure that you at least set the `BOT_TOKEN` and `COMMUNITY` variables before continuing, next you can run `npm run dev` to start the bot locally.

If everything is set up correctly you should see your bot online.
